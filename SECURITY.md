## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the MLOps Clinical Trials Platform seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: [security@mlops-clinical-trials.com](mailto:security@mlops-clinical-trials.com)

Include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- **Response Time**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the vulnerability within 5 business days.
- **Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress, at least every 7 days.
- **Resolution**: We will work to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days of validation.

### Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue before public disclosure
- Avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not access or modify data that doesn't belong to you

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing to this project, please follow these security guidelines:

#### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries or ORM methods
- **XSS Prevention**: Escape output and use Content Security Policy
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords

#### Dependencies

- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- **Security Scanning**: Use tools like `safety` or `bandit` to scan for vulnerabilities
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only include necessary dependencies

#### Docker Security

- **Base Images**: Use official, minimal base images
- **User Privileges**: Run containers as non-root users
- **Secrets**: Use Docker secrets or Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
- **Image Scanning**: Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities

#### Kubernetes Security

- **RBAC**: Implement Role-Based Access Control
- **Network Policies**: Use network policies to restrict pod communication
- **Pod Security**: Use Pod Security Standards
- **Secrets**: Use Kubernetes secrets for sensitive configuration

### For Deployments

#### Infrastructure Security

- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate different components using network policies
- **TLS/SSL**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Firewall Rules**: Implement proper firewall rules and security groups
- **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring and alerting

#### Data Security

- **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data in databases and storage
- **Encryption in Transit**: Use TLS for all data transmission
