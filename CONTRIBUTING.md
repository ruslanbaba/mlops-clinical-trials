## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment
4. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
5. Make your changes
6. Test your changes
7. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- kubectl (for Kubernetes deployments)
- Git

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlops-clinical-trials.git
   cd mlops-clinical-trials
   ```

2. **Set up the development environment:**
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

3. **Start the development services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Run tests to verify setup:**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes**: Fix existing bugs in the codebase
- **New features**: Add new functionality to the platform
- **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
- **Performance improvements**: Optimize existing code
- **Refactoring**: Improve code structure and maintainability

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names that indicate the type and scope of your changes:

- `feature/add-new-cancer-model`
- `bugfix/fix-ab-testing-traffic-split`
- `docs/update-api-documentation`
- `test/add-integration-tests`
- `refactor/improve-data-pipeline`

### Commit Message Format

Follow the conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(training): add support for ensemble models
fix(api): resolve authentication token validation issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines**
2. **Update documentation** if you're adding new features
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Ensure all tests pass** locally before submitting
5. **Update the changelog** if applicable
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Pull Request Template

```markdown
## Description
Brief description of the changes made.

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing
- [ ] Tests pass locally with my changes
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes

## Checklist
- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines of this project
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation

```

## Issue Reporting

When reporting issues, please include:

1. **Clear description** of the problem
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Expected behavior**
4. **Actual behavior**
5. **Environment details** (OS, Python version, etc.)
6. **Error messages** or stack traces
7. **Screenshots** if applicable

### Issue Labels

We use the following labels to categorize issues:

- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `enhancement`: New feature or request
- `documentation`: Improvements or additions to documentation
- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Extra attention is needed
- `priority:high`: High priority issues
- `priority:medium`: Medium priority issues
- `priority:low`: Low priority issues

## Documentation

### API Documentation

- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Follow Google or NumPy docstring style
- Include examples in docstrings where helpful

### README Updates

- Keep the README up to date with new features
- Include examples of new functionality
- Update installation instructions if needed

### Architecture Documentation

- Document significant architectural decisions
- Update diagrams when adding new components
- Explain data flow and system interactions

## Testing

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: Test system performance
5. **Security Tests**: Test security vulnerabilities

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both happy path and error cases

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run unit tests only
pytest tests/unit/

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

## Code Style

### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use Black for code formatting
- Use isort for import sorting
- Use flake8 for linting
- Use mypy for type checking

### Code Quality Tools

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Check code style
make lint

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Security check
bandit -r src/
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run pre-commit hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development

1. Create a new branch from `main`
2. Implement your feature
3. Write tests for your feature
4. Update documentation
5. Run tests and ensure they pass
6. Submit a pull request

### Bug Fixes

1. Reproduce the bug locally
2. Write a test that demonstrates the bug
3. Fix the bug
4. Ensure the test passes
5. Submit a pull request

### Release Process

1. Update version numbers
2. Update changelog
3. Create a release branch
4. Test thoroughly
5. Create a pull request to main
6. Tag the release after merge

## Security

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please report security vulnerabilities privately to the maintainers. Do not create public issues for security problems.

### Security Best Practices

- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow security scanning guidelines
- Keep dependencies up to date

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Guidelines

- Profile code before optimizing
- Focus on algorithmic improvements first
- Consider memory usage in data processing
- Use appropriate data structures
- Cache expensive computations

### Monitoring Performance

- Monitor model training times
- Track API response times
- Monitor memory usage
- Track database query performance

## Questions and Support

If you have questions about contributing:

1. Check existing issues and documentation
2. Search previous discussions
3. Create a new issue with the `question` label
4. Reach out to maintainers if needed

## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:

- The project's README
- Release notes
- Annual contributor reports
